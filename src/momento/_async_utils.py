# NOTES:
#
# 1. it would be really nice to put some more meaningful type hints here but I'm not familiar
#    enough with asyncio / coroutines to understand their types.
# 2. Kenny believes that we should be able to do this without a direct dependency on asyncio,
#    by writing a loop that calls `send` on the coroutine and then returns on StopIteration.
#    I was not able to get this working during my timeboxed window so left it like this for now.
